# Defining the Eye-tracking windows for CGE ET Summary Analysis

This file identifies the main time windows (with respect to trial events) that will be used in simple average-based analyses of pupillometry in the CGE study. 

## Window 1: 

**Start T:** 500ms before choice option presentation
**End T:** 500ms after choice option presentation
**Notes:** This will _partially_ overlap with window 4 (mid/late ITI) b/c of the 0.5s into the ITI. 

We expect effects of choice & prev. difficulty (risky > safe; prev. diff > prev. easy), which should (at least partially) parallel effects observed in window 4 (mid/late ITI). 

## Window 2: ISI

**Start T:** ISI start / Choice (i.e. moment of decision)
**End T:** ISI end / Outcome start
**Notes:** This spans the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between the choice and the outcome. This window is expected to show effects of current ease/difficulty (Easy > Difficult). 

This may also show effects of choice made (easy choice (risky or safe) = difficult risky, and difficult safe is lower).

No effect anticipated of prev. difficulty.

_This is like Sheng et al (2020); they did 0.5s before choice to 1.5s after._

## Window 3: Outcome+

**Start T:** Outcome start
**End T:** Outcome end + 1000ms (i.e. 1s after ITI start)
**Notes:** This spans 2 seconds total (Outcome & first second of ITI). This is expected to show strong choice effects (Risky >> Safe). 

## Window 4: Middle/late ITI

**Start T:** 1000ms after ITI start
**End T:** 3000ms seconds after ITI start
**Notes:** This spans seconds 1-3 of the ITI, after the brief decrease post-outcome. This window is expected to show effects of current ease/difficulty (Difficult > Easy).

This may also show effects of choice made (easy risky = difficult (risky or safe)).


## Other ideas
- We may want to return to this and define windows (or points) that we think will _not_ show effects of difficulty or indiv. diffs, like dilation @ moment of choice.
